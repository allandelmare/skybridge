# SKY Bridge - Airbyte Connector for Blackbaud NXT

An open-source Airbyte connector that enables seamless data integration between Blackbaud NXT (via SKY API) and 60+ modern data platforms including Snowflake, BigQuery, PostgreSQL, and more.

## üéØ Overview

SKY Bridge democratizes access to NXT data by providing a no-code/low-code solution for streaming your Blackbaud data directly into your data infrastructure. Built for the Blackbaud developer community, this connector eliminates the complexity of custom API development while providing enterprise-grade reliability.

- **OAuth 2.0 Authentication**: Secure, automatic token management
- **Incremental Sync**: Efficient data updates with configurable date ranges
- **Custom Queries**: Execute NXT queries with parameter support
- **Production Ready**: Built-in pagination, retry logic, and error handling
- **Open Source**: MIT licensed for community contribution and customization

## üìä Supported Data Streams

- ‚úÖ Constituents (with full profile data)
- ‚úÖ Gifts and Gift Custom Fields
- ‚úÖ Campaigns, Funds, and Appeals
- ‚úÖ Opportunities
- ‚úÖ Actions and Notes
- ‚úÖ Addresses, Phones, and Emails
- ‚úÖ Relationships
- ‚úÖ Constituent Codes and Custom Fields
- ‚úÖ Code Tables
- ‚úÖ Custom Queries (with parameters)

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. **Airbyte Instance**: Airbyte Cloud (self hosted may require modification depending on CDK version)
2. **SKY API Access**: 
   - Blackbaud developer account
   - Registered SKY application
   - API subscription key

### Installation Steps

#### Step 1: Register Your SKY Application

1. Go to [SKY Developer Portal](https://developer.blackbaud.com)
2. Create a new application
3. Note your:
   - Application ID (Client ID)
   - Application Secret
   - Subscription Key

#### Step 2: Add Connector to Airbyte

1. In Airbyte, go to **Workspace** ‚Üí **Builder**
2. Click **+ New Custom Connector**
3. Choose **Import from YAML**
4. Choose `skybridge-connector.yaml` from your file system.
5. Name it (example, "Blackbaud NXT (SKY API)").
6. Configure Query ID's and/or Codetable ID's. Duplicate streams to create and customize your own!
7. Test if desired (especially if you made any changes) - note that manually adding an access token is required for first test in builder mode (not required in production).
8. Click 'Publish' to your own organization.

#### Step 3: Configure Connection

1. Create a new source using your custom connector
2. Enter your credentials:
   - **Client ID**: Your SKY application ID
   - **Client Secret**: Your SKY application secret
   - **Subscription Key**: Your SKY API subscription key
   - **Start Date**: Date from which to sync data (e.g., 2020-01-01T00:00:00Z which is the default if left blank)
3. Complete OAuth authorization when prompted
4. Test and save the connection

#### Step 4: Set Up Destination

Choose from 60+ destinations:
- **Data Warehouses**: Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, Databricks
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, MS SQL Server
- **Data Lakes**: S3, Azure Blob, GCS
- **And many more...**

#### Step 5: Configure Sync

1. Select the streams (which fields from which API's, and/or queries) you want to sync. Note that large data sets may consume your API limits - start small. 
2. Choose sync frequency (e.g., hourly, daily)
3. Configure sync mode (Full Refresh or Incremental)
4. Start syncing!

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Custom Query Configuration

To use custom NXT queries, modify the query ID in the YAML -- or -- in the builder UI:

```yaml
gift_query:
  creation_requester:
    request_body:
      value:
        id: YOUR_QUERY_ID  # Replace with your NXT query ID
        parameters:
          DateFrom: "{{ stream_interval.start_time }}"
          DateTo: "{{ stream_interval.end_time }}"
```

### Code Table Configuration

To sync specific code tables, update the table ID:

```yaml
codetable_solicitcodes:
  requester:
    url: >-
      https://api.sky.blackbaud.com/codetable/v1/codetables/YOUR_TABLE_ID/tableentries
```

### Incremental Sync Settings

Adjust the incremental sync parameters:

```yaml
incremental_sync:
  step: P30D  # Sync window size (30 days)
  lookback_window: PT2H  # Overlap window (2 hours)
  cursor_field: date_modified  # Field to track changes
```

## üìñ Documentation

### Authentication Flow

The connector handles OAuth 2.0 authentication automatically:
1. Initial authorization via Blackbaud login
2. Automatic token refresh
3. Secure credential storage in Airbyte
4. SPECIAL NOTE: there is a bug with sliding window refresh token management. For now, as a bypass, refresh token is set to static = TRUE, which will keep the refresh token valid for 1 year, at which point it will require re-authentication. This will be improved to properly handle token refresh in future versions. 

### Pagination Strategies

Two pagination methods are supported:
- **Offset Pagination**: For standard endpoints
- **Continuation Token**: For large result sets

### Error Handling

Built-in resilience features:
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Graceful handling of rate limits
- Detailed error logging

## üìä Use Cases

### Unified Analytics Platform
Stream NXT data to Snowflake alongside marketing and financial data for comprehensive analytics.

### Custom Applications
Sync constituent data to PostgreSQL to power donor portals and custom applications.

### Data Science & ML
Load data into Databricks for predictive modeling and advanced analytics.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**OAuth Error**: Ensure redirect URI in SKY app matches Airbyte's callback URL

**No Data Syncing**: Check that your API subscription includes the required scopes

**Slow Performance**: Consider reducing sync frequency or limiting date ranges

**Query Timeout**: For large queries, increase the timeout in the YAML configuration
